# Springer

A chess engine using the UCI protocol.

## Development

Could be cool to write an engine that could be given advice on how to
play by submitting advice during a game, so for instance if the engine
was told to improve the position of the knight then it would favor
knight moves during search and evaluation of new moves.

Examples:
- launch pawn attach down the center
- launch pawn attach on the queen side
- go for bishop swap
- take e4
- pressure on e4
- defend e4
